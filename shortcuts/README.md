## Overview

These are shortcuts for the app named "Shortcuts". I have no idea how you're supposed to save/load these (do they just roam with iCloud?), so I'm going to just copy/paste them occasionally into this folder and maybe write up a summary of what they do.

- `reference_link`: bound to ⌃⌥⌘⇧R (i.e. hyper+R). Types out "(reference)" and turns it into a link using the contents of the clipboard.
